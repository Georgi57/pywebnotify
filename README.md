# pywebnotify
Simple notification server suing python.

Purpose of this project is to notify the user by sending mail when certain parameters on a webpage change.

I had to find accomodation on blocket.se, in Stockholm.
Problem there is that there is very high competition between renters, so to get attention of the apartment owner you have to be one of the first to apply.
Of course I do not want sit on the website and wait until a suitable offer comes. Send an email to myself with a notification i sufficiently fast for me.
But I want to build a more general purpose application.
